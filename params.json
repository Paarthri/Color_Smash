{"name":"Color Smash","tagline":"Mobile game made with Kivy","body":"# Color_Smash\r\n\r\nThis is a mobile game I am in the process of creating. It uses python with an open source gui library called Kivy(http://kivy.org/#home).\r\n\r\nThe way you play is by hitting the green tiles while avoiding the blue ones. The green ones give you one point while the blue ones reduce one point. You have ten seconds to complete the task.\r\n\r\nTo use the Adbuddiz itegration you have to edit you AndroidManifest and edit your buildozer.spec. Here is a tutorial(https://github.com/kivy/kivy/wiki/AdBuddiz-Android-advertisements-integration-for-Kivy-apps).\r\nThis can be used to have an Adbuddiz example or as a Kivy example as well.\r\n\r\nThe theme I used for this project was created by Federico Curzel. Here it the repository: https://github.com/Cuuuurzel/kivy-material-ui.\r\nI only used the default image, not the whole project.\r\n\r\nHere are some screenshots:\r\n\r\n![Alt text](https://github.com/Paarthri/Color_Smash/blob/master/screenshots/HomePage.png?raw=true \"Menu\")\r\n\r\n![Alt text](https://github.com/Paarthri/Color_Smash/blob/master/screenshots/Game.png?raw=true \"During Gameplay\")\r\n\r\n![Alt text](https://github.com/Paarthri/Color_Smash/blob/master/screenshots/End.png?raw=true \"After Game\")","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
