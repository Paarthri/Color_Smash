{"name":"Color Smash","tagline":"Mobile game made with Kivy","body":"# Color Smash\r\n\r\nThis is a mobile game I am in the process of creating. It uses python with an open source gui library called Kivy(http://kivy.org/#home).\r\n\r\nTo use the Adbuddiz itegration you have to edit you AndroidManifest and edit your buildozer.spec. Here is a tutorial(https://github.com/kivy/kivy/wiki/AdBuddiz-Android-advertisements-integration-for-Kivy-apps).\r\nThis can be used to have an Adbuddiz example or as a Kivy example as well.\r\n\r\nThe theme I used for this project was created by Federico Curzel. Here it the repository: https://github.com/Cuuuurzel/kivy-material-ui.\r\nI only used the default image, not the whole project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
