# Color_Smash

This is a mobile game I am in the process of creating. It uses python with an open source gui library called Kivy(http://kivy.org/#home).

To use the Adbuddiz itegration you have to edit you AndroidManifest and wdit your buildozer.spec. Here is a tutorial(https://github.com/kivy/kivy/wiki/AdBuddiz-Android-advertisements-integration-for-Kivy-apps).
This can be used to have an Adbuddiz example or as a Kivy example as well.
