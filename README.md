# Color_Smash

This is a mobile game I am in the process of creating. It uses python with an open source gui library called Kivy(http://kivy.org/#home).

The way you play is by hitting the green tiles while avoiding the blue ones. The green ones give you one point while the blue ones reduce one point. You have ten seconds to complete the task.

To use the Adbuddiz itegration you have to edit you AndroidManifest and edit your buildozer.spec. Here is a tutorial(https://github.com/kivy/kivy/wiki/AdBuddiz-Android-advertisements-integration-for-Kivy-apps).
This can be used to have an Adbuddiz example or as a Kivy example as well.

The theme I used for this project was created by Federico Curzel. Here it the repository: https://github.com/Cuuuurzel/kivy-material-ui.
I only used the default image, not the whole project.

Here are some screenshots:
